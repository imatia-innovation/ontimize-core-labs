        <ul>
            <Li><font face="Verdana">&lt;, &lt;=,=,&gt;=,&gt; at the beginning. For example:
            &lt;12, o &gt;=67</font>
            <Li><font face="Verdana">':' In order to make searches in a range. For example: '12:34' is the
            same as 'between 12 and 34', both included.  When searching dates, '01/07/2007:16/07/2007'
            is the same as 'between 01/07/2007 and 16/07/2007', both included</font>
            <Li><font face="Verdana">  The pipe symbol '|' is used to make searches with several values. For example:
            12|34|56 is the same as '12 or 34 or 56'.  The same with dates, for example, '01/07/2007|16/07/2007' </font>
            <Li><font face="Verdana">The exclamation point '!' is used to make searches with <i>not equals</i> condition. By
             writing '!' in the field the search condition returns all the values that are different
             from the value after the '!'. For example: '!24' is the same as 'not equal to 24'. And '!' alone
            is the same as an empty field</font>
